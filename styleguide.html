                            The purpose of this website is to allow our audience to receive inspiration, information, and ideas. These things come from recommending and giving information on different activities to do while bored. The audience will be able to choose something interesting to them, get a list of activities that are similar to that interest, and then be given information about it and how they can do that activity. They can receive this all from the safety and comfort of their homes as they browse this website. It was created as a way to overcome the sometimes inevitable onset of boredom. It also links to different websites, where if people book or pay for something, this website gets a commission. This website is available 24/7, and anyone can receive information from anywhere.

                            I chose these colors because they go well with each other, and are not too vibrant or distracting. I also chose some of these colors because they were on opposite sides of the color wheel, making them complementary colors.
